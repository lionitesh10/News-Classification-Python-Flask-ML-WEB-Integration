# News-Classification-Python-Flask-ML-WEB-Integration
### This project integrates trained Machine Learning Algorithms Support Vector Machine and Multinomial Naives Bayes with Web using Flask a microwebframework of Python.

This project aims to classify fake and real news based on different machine learning algorithms from dataset of Kaggle with collaboration with another dataset of 20
newsgroup from built in scikit learn module. This web app classifies the input news as fake or real and if the news is fake the news is discarded and not inserted into 
the database.As the result real it classifies its category further.

Support Vector Machine Performed best with both of the datasets.
